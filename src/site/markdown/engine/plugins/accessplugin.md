#AccessPlugin
The AccessPlugin is responsible for the ACL settings in a workitem.

    org.imixs.workflow.plugins.AccessPlugin

The Plugin adds or removes read and write access entries into a WorkItem:
 
   * $ReadAccess
   * $WriteAccess
   
Which entries are added can be defined in the workflow model using the [Imixs-BPMN Modeler](../../modelling/index.html). See also the [section security](../acl.html) for more details.
